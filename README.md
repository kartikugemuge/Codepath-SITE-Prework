## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [X] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [X] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [X] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [X] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [X] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [X] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

The CSS part of this assignment was a struggle for me. My assignment lacks an aesthetic appeal that comes with good CSS skills, and due to a lack of practice with CSS, I decided it would be best to stick with a simple and minimalistic design. The rest of the assignment was straightforward, and the instructions were clear which helped me get started with the assignment. Another challenge I encountered was using a timer for the game. Before using the setInterval and clearInterval methods I thought of using something more conventional, like a loop. But that would not make any sense since a 30 count for loop is almost instantaneous, and I needed something more realistic than that functions, like a clock. Thankfully, the setInterval and clearInterval methods were designed to do exactly that. But even after that, I had to figure out how to implement them as these were functions, I had never used before. I came across a lot of bugs while implementing these functions. For instance, the set Interval function would be invoked twice, and no clear interval was invoked hence the timer would go down by 2 every time this happened. After altering playClueSequence() function and making another function along with multiple variables and overcoming multiple bugs, I finally produced a way to display the timer the way I wanted it to work.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

After completing my submission, I was curious about which element of a web project requires the most attention. All 3 HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are supposed to work with each other, and there will always be a balance between them. But is there just one aspect that requires more attention than the others or could this be wrong to classify them. Intuitively, I would believe that JavaScript requires more attention, next would-be CSS and finally HTML. But after doing this project I could see there is always some balance between them. Another question came up when I was thinking about additional features. Is it possible to implement a statistics page (something that a user can view after reopening the site) by using only these three web development tools, I believe using cookies and sessions can be helpful in this situation. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had time to learn more about features such as sessions and cookies, I would have made a statistics page where the player can view some interesting data about them - it is always fun to watch personal stats. Such as high score, average time taken between each click, and with a little more ambition â€“ how they compare with other players and much more. Another feature I would implement is game settings, where the user can customize the game speed, timer, number of blocks, changing themes, etc. Furthermore, I would learn more CSS skills to implement aesthetic elements to my project. And implementing the fifth option which was about adding images and different sounds. Overall, I would fix the UI to not only look better but also give the user a better experience.
